# django_cowsay
# TODOS:
# Create Superuser
# Create models
#   - resembles input, creates cow
#   - has user history of inputs
# Create Views
#   - take input, create model, produce cow logic  ***
#   - when new input is entered, removes what's on screen
#       and produces the new view
#       _view before and after input. after view always relates
#           to the new input model in request
# 
# *** Create the models and views, just store the text and print it,
#   and then attempt to introduce the subprocess function to run cowsay
